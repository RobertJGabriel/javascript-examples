#Problems
###The Fortune Teller
Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

- Store the following into variables: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
-  Output your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."


###The Age Calculator

Forgot how old someone is? Calculate it!

- Store the current year in a variable.
- Store their birth year in a variable.
- Calculate their 2 possible ages based on the stored values.
- Output them to the screen like so: "They are either NN or NN", substituting the values.

###The Lifetime Supply Calculator

Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

- Store your current age into a variable.
- Store a maximum age into a variable.
- Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
- Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
- Output the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".


### The Geometrizer

Calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

- Store a radius into a variable.
- Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
- Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".


### The Temperature Converter

It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

- Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
- Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
- Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."



### What number's bigger?

Write a function named greaterNum that:
- takes 2 arguments, both numbers.
- returns whichever number is the greater (higher) number.
- Call that function 2 times with different number pairs, and log the output to make sure it works (e.g. "The greater number of 5 and 10 is 10.").

### The Grade Assigner ?

-Write a function named assignGrade that:
-- Takes 1 argument, a number score.
-- returns a grade for the score, either "A", "B", "C", "D", or "F".
- Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.

### The Pluralizer
 - Write a function named pluralize that:
 -- takes 2 arguments, a noun and a number.
 -- returns the number and pluralized form, like "5 cats" or "1 dog".
 --  Call that function for a few different scores and log the result to make sure it works.
